      <h3>What?</h3>

      <p>Call provided functions when the specified elements transition from above the current window to above the current window, or from left to right.</p>

      <script type="text/javascript">
        function WaypointsExampleCtrl($scope) {
          $scope.callback = function(direction, element) {
            $scope.direction = direction;

        <p style="height: 100px">Try scrolling past the red text or changing the offset</p>

    <div class="span6">
      <h3>Why?</h3>

      <p>Trigger class changes on different menu elements (e.g. in a sticky navbar) when key elements are passed, trigger animations based on page position</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>How?</h3>

  <h4>Define your callback function</h4>
  <pre class="prettyprint">$scope.callback = function(direction, element) {
    $scope.callback = function(direction, element) {
      $scope.direction = direction;
    };
  }
  </pre>

  <h4>Configure ui-waypoints</h4>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
    &lt;p ui-waypoints="callback"&gt;They see me scrollin...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p id="waypointsOutput" ng-hide="direction == null"&gt;You scrolled {{direction}} past the message&lt;/p&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>The argument to ui-waypoints should be an expression that evaluates to either an object or a function.</p>
  <p>If it is a function, the function will be called with the arguments (direction, element),
   where direction is a string that is one of "up", "down", "left", or "right". The element
   will be the element that triggered the callback.</p>
  <p>
  <p>You can optionally pass an object to waypoints <code>ui-waypoints</code>. The following options are valid:
    <table>
      <tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Description</th></tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code> enter </code></td><td> Function that is called when transition from above to below or left to right. Passed the direction (down, right), and the element. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code> exit </code></td><td> Function that is called when transitioning from below to above or right to left. Passed the direction (up, left), and the element.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code> both </code></td><td> Function that is called when transitioning in either directionPassed the direction (left, right up, down), and the element. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code> offset </code></td><td> Object which specifies the the detected y-offset of the element. Should be an object that looks like <code>{"vertical": 10, "horizontal":15}</code>. Values can be either absolute
    <code>600</code> or offset from the calculated value -50 or +100. In the latter case, they should be strings, and in the former, numbers.</td>
      </tr>
    which would override the detected y-offset of the element. Values can be either absolute
    <code>600</code> or offset from the calculated value <code>-50</code> or <code>+100</code>.</p>
